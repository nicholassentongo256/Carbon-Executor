About
Carbon Executor is a developer tool. It provides a local runtime to load and run Lua scripts in controlled sandboxes. The tool focuses on safety, speed, and clarity. It helps creators test gameplay code, run automated checks, and prototype server-side logic in an environment that mirrors Roblox Lua semantics. Avoid using it for anything that violates platform rules.

Core design and architecture
Carbon Executor divides responsibilities across clear modules. Each module has a single purpose and a small API.

- Loader
  - Accepts a script file or string.
  - Performs static input checks.
  - Produces a bytecode or AST representation for the runtime.

- Sandbox
  - Runs scripts in isolated environments.
  - Provides a safe set of global objects.
  - Controls resource limits and timeouts.

- Service Stubs
  - Provide mock implementations of common Roblox services:
    - Workspace, Players, ReplicatedStorage, HttpService (stubbed), DataStoreService (stub).
  - Stubs log calls and expose hooks for test injection.

- Debugger
  - Exposes step, breakpoint, inspect.
  - Connects to local UIs or CI logs.

- CLI and API
  - Allows headless runs.
  - Offers script orchestration for test suites.

- Plugin host
  - Loads small helper modules that add assertions, mocks, or test fixtures.

High-level security model
- Sandbox only provides a minimal global environment. Avoid exposing host resources unless explicitly requested.
- Do not run untrusted code with elevated privileges.
- Default builds disable network access and file writes. Tests can opt in to limited IO under explicit config.
- Use host-side review and code signing for any distributed binaries.
- Always build from source when testing sensitive projects.

Installation (safe, source-first)
This project favors building from source. Building from source lets you inspect the code and control runtime flags.

1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/nicholassentongo256/Carbon-Executor.git
   - cd Carbon-Executor

2. Install dependencies
   - Use the language-specific package manager described in the repo (for example, npm, pip, cargo).
   - On Windows, ensure build tools are available: Visual Studio Build Tools or equivalent.
   - On macOS, ensure Xcode command line tools or relevant compilers are installed.

3. Build
   - Run the provided build script:
     - build.sh (Unix)
     - build.bat (Windows)
   - Or use the language build command shown in repo-config.

4. Run tests locally
   - ./scripts/run-tests.sh
   - This runs unit tests in sandboxes and validates service stubs.

Releases and prebuilt artifacts
Check the Releases page for official builds, checksums, and source archives:
https://github.com/nicholassentongo256/Carbon-Executor/releases

If you choose to use a release artifact, verify signatures and checksums before running. Prefer to run the code in a controlled environment and inspect binaries.

Local sandbox usage
The typical local use case is to run a script with mocked services and gather logs.

CLI example (safe):
- ./carbon exec --script examples/movement.lua --timeout 5000 --mock Players,Workspace

This command:
- Loads examples/movement.lua
- Runs it inside a sandbox for 5 seconds
- Injects mock Players and Workspace services

The runtime prints structured logs and an exit code. It never enables outbound network access by default.

Sandbox config (sample)
- sandbox.config.json
  - timeout: 5000
  - memoryLimit: 64MB
  - services:
    - Players: mock
    - HttpService: disabled
  - io:
    - allowFileWrite: false

The CLI reads this config when launching tests.

API reference (safe operations)
Below are the main runtime APIs. Keep in mind these are high-level, safe functions meant for testing and automation.

Loader API
- Loader.loadScript(pathOrString)
  - Returns a ScriptObject with metadata and compiled form.
  - Throws on syntax errors.
- Loader.parse(scriptSource)
  - Returns AST for static analysis.

Sandbox API
- Sandbox.create(options)
  - options:
    - timeoutMs
    - memoryLimitBytes
    - allowFileIO (boolean)
    - allowNetwork (boolean; default false)
  - Returns a Sandbox instance.

- sandbox:run(scriptObject)
  - Executes the script inside the sandbox.
  - Returns RunResult: { status, logs, errors, metrics }.

- sandbox:step()
  - Executes one VM tick for debugging.

- sandbox:setGlobal(name, value)
  - Injects a safe global into the script environment.

Service stubs
- Services.Workspace
  - Provides a minimal scene graph API with nodes and transforms.
  - Emits events for property changes.

- Services.Players
  - Mocks player join/leave.
  - Allows scripted actions for tests.

- Services.ReplicatedStorage
  - Stores test assets used by scripts.

Debugging API
- Debugger.attach(sandbox)
  - Opens a local socket for a debug client.
- Debugger.setBreakpoint(scriptId, line)
- Debugger.inspect(frame)
  - Returns a snapshot of variables.

Plugin API
- Plugin.register(name, api)
  - Allows small helper modules to extend the test runtime.
  - Plugins run in a restricted plugin host.

Example workflows
Unit testing a module
1. Add a test file tests/test_player_movement.lua
2. Use the Services API to create a mock player.
3. Run the test:
   - ./carbon test --file tests/test_player_movement.lua

End-to-end scenario run
1. Create a scenario script scenarios/round_flow.lua that runs through a simplified game round.
2. Use scheduler mock to simulate time.
3. Run headless:
   - ./carbon run --scenario scenarios/round_flow.lua --report reports/round_flow.json

Profiling CPU hot paths
- ./carbon profile --script examples/pathfinding.lua --output profile.cpuprofile
- Use the included profile viewer to inspect slow functions.

Debugging with breakpoints
- ./carbon debug --script examples/ai.lua
- Use the local debug client or VSCode integration to step through lines.

Debugging and profiling tools
- Step-based debugger for small scripts.
- Time-slice profiler that reports function wall time and call counts.
- Memory sampler to detect runaway allocation.
- Flamegraph export compatible with standard viewers.

CI and testing
Carbon Executor integrates with CI systems. The CLI supports headless runs, JSON output, and strict exit codes. Use these patterns:

Example GitHub Actions job
- name: Run unit tests
  run: |
    ./carbon test --suite tests --report test-report.json
    cat test-report.json
  env:
    CI: true

Exit codes
- 0: success
- 1: test failures
- 2: runtime error
- 3: config error

Logging and telemetry
Carbon Executor logs in structured JSON format. Each entry contains:
- timestamp
- level (info, warn, error)
- source (script, runtime, service)
- message
- context

Log sink options
- stdout (default)
- file path
- JSON stream for CI ingestion

Telemetry
- The core runtime does not collect telemetry by default.
- Developers can enable opt-in telemetry in config for diagnostics in development only.
- Never enable telemetry in CI or production workflows without consent.

Acknowledgments
Thanks to contributors, maintainers, and testers who follow safe and ethical practices. Use this tool to build better games and to improve code quality.

Appendix: Sample test pattern
This pattern shows how to structure a test that uses mocks and asserts behavior.

1. Test file: tests/test_spawn_flow.lua
2. Setup
   - Create a sandbox with Players and Workspace mocks.
   - Load the module under test.
3. Exercise
   - Simulate a player joining.
   - Call the spawn function in the module.
4. Assert
   - Check that the player's character appears in Workspace mock.
   - Check that spawn uses the right transform and properties.

Sample test (pseudo-Lua)
```lua
local Carbon = require("carbon")
local sandbox = Carbon.Sandbox.create({ timeoutMs = 2000 })

sandbox:setGlobal("Players", Carbon.Services.Players.mock())
sandbox:setGlobal("Workspace", Carbon.Services.Workspace.mock())

local script = Carbon.Loader.loadScript("examples/spawn_module.lua")
local result = sandbox:run(script)

assert(result.status == "ok")
assert(#sandbox.Services.Workspace:getChildren() > 0)
```
